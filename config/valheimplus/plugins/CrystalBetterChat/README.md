Adds configurable features to the chat system.

* Show the chat window when a message is received, or have it always visible.
* Configure how long the window shows when a new message is received.
* Remove the force caps from shouts and force lower case from whispers.
* Pressing the slash key (``/``) will open the chat window and start a message.
* Option to not see map pings when players shout.
* Switch so that the chat default is shout (use ``/say`` to not shout).
* Configure talk and whisper distances.
* Able to interact with UI that is behind the chat window (click-through).

Most everything listed is configurable. Run the game once with the mod enabled to generate the config. See config for details on what each option does.

## Installation
This mod is designed to install and run via [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/). You can optionally install it manually following the steps below.

**Manual Install**

1. Install [BepInExPack Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
